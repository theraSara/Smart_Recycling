# Smart Recycling: Automated Object Detection and Classification for Informed Policy and Enhanced Recycling (AODCIPER)

## Project Overview

The **Smart Recycling** project addresses the global challenge of inefficient waste management and rising contamination rates in recycled materials. By integrating advanced machine learning (ML) and high-speed cameras with image recognition technology, this system aims to improve the accuracy of waste sorting significantly, surpassing manual methods by 80-90%. The result is enhanced efficiency in waste management and higher-quality recycled materials, contributing to environmental sustainability.
